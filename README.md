## About Atari 2600 Breakout
This game is a port of the original Breakout from 1976. In this game you need to break 6 rows of bricks two times to beat the game. First two rows (blue and green) are worth one point. Third and fourth (yellow and dark orange) are worth four points and the last two rows (orange and red) are worth seven points. The ball is served from one of three locations chosen randomly. When the ball hits the paddle four times it's angle gets straighter. After another four hits (eight in total) the angle gets more flat and the ball gets faster. After another four (twelve in total) the angle gets more straight again and the ball speeds up again. When the ball hits the one of three last rows the speed is the fastest possible and the angle is the same as it was in the beggining when the ball was served (45 degrees). When the ball touches top wall the paddle shrinks and when the ball falls out paddle returns back to normal length. When you loose the ball 5 times you loose the game.

## Controls
